"""Tests for Feishu adapter outbound markdown payload construction.

Reproduces the bug tracked in hermes-agent issue #52786:
`_build_outbound_payload` was force-downgrading any message containing a
markdown pipe table to ``msg_type=text``, so Feishu clients rendered the raw
pipe-and-dash source instead of a table.  Empirically current Feishu clients
render ``post``+``md`` tables natively, so the downgrade branch must be removed.

These tests guard the fix by building the payload a chunk is sent with.
